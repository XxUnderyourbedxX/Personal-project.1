        <p>I Took this class because I was interested in the coding for the very first time I tried it I genuinely confused. I will say this class took me a while to understand it was very difficult to comprehend what we learning since everyone else here had a more coding experience then I did. But I soon on caught up with them.</p>

        Played baseball for my freshmen and sophomore year.
        I was positioned at 2nd base and outfield center and both left and right field. I mostly had to practice a lot on my ground balls. I enjoyed it since I played most of my school years. I played in championship games multiple times.</p>
